VPN Setup and Analysis

Objective  
The purpose of this task was to install and configure a VPN, verify that the IP address changes while connected, and analyze the benefits and limitations of VPN usage.

Steps Performed  
1. Selected a free VPN provider (ProtonVPN was used).  
2. Downloaded and installed the VPN client on Windows.  
3. Created a free account and logged into the VPN application.  
4. Connected to a VPN server in the nearest available location.  
5. Verified the IP change using https://whatismyipaddress.com before and after connection.  
6. Accessed websites while connected to confirm that traffic was encrypted and routed through the VPN server.  
7. Disconnected the VPN and compared speed and IP details with the connected state.  

Findings  
- The original IP address was successfully masked and replaced with the VPN serverâ€™s IP.  
- Browsing activity was routed through the VPN, confirming encrypted tunneling.  
- A slight reduction in internet speed was observed during VPN usage.  

Benefits of VPN  
- Hides the real IP address and location.  
- Encrypts internet traffic, protecting against interception.  
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions and censorship.  
- Provides security on untrusted networks such as public Wi-Fi.  

Limitations of VPN  
- May cause reduced browsing speed due to encryption and server distance.  
- Requires trust in the VPN provider since they can potentially see traffic.  
- Free VPNs may have limited bandwidth, slower speeds, and fewer servers.  
- VPN usage does not provide complete anonymity.  

Conclusion  
The VPN setup and testing confirmed that the tool effectively secured browsing traffic and masked the real IP address. While VPNs enhance privacy and security, they also introduce performance trade-offs and depend heavily on the reliability of the provider.
